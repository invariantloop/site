## Intro 
### Tautology

- A compound proposition that is **always true**, no matter what the truth values of the propositional variables that occur in it
    - **$p \vee \neg p$**

### Contradiction

- A compound proposition that is **always false**, no matter what the truth values of the propositional variables that occur in it
    - **$p \wedge \neg p$**

### Contingency

- A compound proposition that is neither a **tautology** nor a **contradiction**.
- Can have **both true and false** as its true values

## Logical equivalences

- The compound propositions p and q are called **logically equivalen**t if p ↔ q is a **tautology**.
- $p \equiv q$

## Satisfiable

- There is an assignment of truth values to its variables that makes it true (named as solution)
- It is **Tautology** or **contingency**
- When it is unsatisfiable, then it is a **contradiction**
- N-queens problem, Sudoku problem
