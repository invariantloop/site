## Terminology

### Arguments (Lập luận)

- A sequence of propositions

### Premises (Tiền đề)

- All propositions but the final one

### Conclusion (Kết luận)

- Final proposition

### Valid Arguments

- if the truth of **premises** **imply** that the **conclusion** is true

### Argument form

- is a sequence of compound propositions involving propositional variables.
- An argument form is valid if no matter which particular propositions are substituted for the propositional variables in its premises, the conclusion is true if the premises are all true.

### Fallacies

- These fallacies resemble rules of inference, but are based on **contingencies** rather than **tautologies**
- Fallacy of denying the hypothesis

$$
((p → q) ∧ ¬p) → ¬q
$$

- Fallacy of aﬃrming the conclusion

$$
((p → q) ∧ q) → p
$$
